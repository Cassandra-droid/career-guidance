BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
The system will examine user profiles, including their educational history, abilities, interests, and job aspirations, using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. After that, it will produce personalized learning plans, career recommendations, and growth techniques to match users with the positions they want. Additionally, the site will include tools to help users better their career chances and skill sets.
WHAT THE TEAM WILL BE WORKING ON?
